# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game-Launcher
This Python script utilizes the Tkinter library to create a graphical user interface (GUI) for launching a Tic-Tac-Toe game. It features a stylish interface with options to start the game or exit. The game itself employs a simple design where players take turns marking spots on the board until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.
